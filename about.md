This site is about how I spend my days.

I think most of the posts will be about software development, but it could veer into other things I'm interested in.

This could include other things that I'm studying, learning, watching, reading, listening, doing or building.

So, yeah, this blog could contain anything. If you like what you are reading, please post a comment, so that I can feel your love.
