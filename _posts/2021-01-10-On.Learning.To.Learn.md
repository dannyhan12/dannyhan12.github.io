I finished the first two weeks of the four week Coursera course called, [On Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

Overall, I'm happy with the course. 

The material is presented in short videos (just a couple minutes long) with a very simple style. The videos are easy to digest and will fit into any busy schedule. The concepts are straightforward; they border on common sense. 

- When you study, focus on the material without any distractions. Then, take a break. Your brain is subconciously processing the material. 
- When you study, focus on the stuff you don't know and test yourself by trying to recall the material.

Looking forward to what the rest of the course will contain. I will post final remarks when I'm done.
