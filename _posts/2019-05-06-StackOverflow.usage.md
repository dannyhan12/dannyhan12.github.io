[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is an awesome source of information and code samples. I think it's safe to say that all programmers consume information from StackOverflow. In contrast, I'd guess that far less people contribute questions, answers, comments and votes to StackOverflow.

## Contributing is good
I think it's good to post on stack overflow. Posting an answer forces you to really think. Will this answer be easy to understand? Are there any better alternatives? What examples can help solidify the unclear concepts? Providing a comprehensive answer helps you uncover holes in your understanding. Teaching is the best form of learning.

Posting a question provides similar benefits. Did I explain my point of confusion clearly? Did I provide the minimal amount of viable code that captures the essence of the problem? Constructing good questions is a skill worth developing. And of course, getting free help for a problem that is stumping you is insane (in an amazing way).

Other than the personal benefits, contributing to the corpus of programming knowledge is a good thing. Help another programmer become a better programmer. Who knows, maybe they end up writing code that ends up in your future car that self-drives your family to and from soccer practice. Let's all hope those programmers wrote some really good code!

Finally, there is the fun of seeing your answers upvoted and watching your reputation points climb. This provides a visceral satisfaction. I suppose it could lead to fame and fortune, but nothing of the sort has happened to me yet.

## Contributing is hard
I was always a bit intimidated to post a question or an answer. If I post something, someone may realize how much of a fraud I am and expose my weak programming skills. It is the same fear that I have when I want someone to review my code. One trick for overcoming the imposter syndrome is just to practice exposing your code and thoughts to others. After a while, you just get used to it, and your fear of being found as a fraud is just washed away, but all the benefits of producing remain. 

Another difficulty is the competition. As I browse for questions to answer, it seems that other programmers are quicker and beating me to the punch. In those cases, I am tempted to hastily post an answer. But this seems like a waste of time. Other than adding reputation points, posting answers to simple questions that someone else will answer in the next minute doesn't meet any of the reasons for why I think contributing is good. 

So, you may be left trying to answer questions that haven't gotten much response. These questions are often unclear, overly specific or complicated, or are just plain difficult to answer.

## Contributing is possible
Last week, I decided to set a goal of contributing something to StackOverflow. I posted a few answers and got some upvotes.

I was hunting for questions and ended up answering some easy ones. It was good to get my feet wet. 

Now, I'd like to shift my approach and try to contribute in a more thoughtful manner. Instead of hunting for easy questions, I'll try to contribute to Stack Overflow while I'm writing code. When I'm stumped or curious about a topic I'll look for help on Stack Overflow as usual. But now, instead of just passively reading, I'll look for opportunites to contribute. This will more often be upvotes, comments, or edits rather than answers.  

Let's see how that goes.
