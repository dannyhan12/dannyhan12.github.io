Your life's work

Everyday you are working on your life's work.

And your life's work doth not wait. Whether you are aware of it or not, you are contributing to your life's work now. It's a sobering truth.

Whether you are building something new, learning about functional programming, or browsing social media, it is all part of your life's work.

The trick is some things seem to accumulate whereas others just evaporate.

We all have a chance to build things of substance. I hope my life's work amounts to something of great substance.
