I just started to learn Haskell. I am reading and learning from [Get Programming with Haskell](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-haskell) by Will Kurt. I have only gotten through a few lessons so far, and I'm excited to learn more. That is a very good start.

I know C++ and Python already. And from what I have read and heard, Haskell is different from those. So, that's why I want to learn it.

The book starts off by saying that learning Haskell can be an "awful time" and also "endlessly rewarding". You'll have to read the book to get more context. This is actually an apt way to describe lots of things I like to do. For example, programming is endlessly frustrating when things are going wrong, and magically awesome when things work. Working out involves straining your body so that it can recover and become stronger later.  

I'm not really sure where learning Haskell will take me. I hope it makes me a better programmer. I hope it gives me another tool at my disposal for solving problems. I hope it's fun. If it fails to meet my expectations, it's probably my fault. Luckily, there is always something else to learn. Erlang sounds like fun.
