title: No such thing as a Quick Question

Developer Annie sits at her desk with a piping hot cup of coffee and plans to work on a new feature in her foo-service. Just as she gets her IDE up and running, Coder Ben stops by and poses the impossible question, "Do you have time for a quick question?" **dun dun daaa!** Developer Annie, hopped up on caffeine, says, "Sure do, what's up?"

So, it begins. Ben asks if Annie's foo-service can be used to blah blah blah. Annie thinks and says, "Hmm ... I guess you could, but that's not its original purpose. It's not a really good fit. It may not perform well in these cases, and it wasn't designed for it, so this and that will be a little awkward. Have you thought about using service-x or library-y? yada yada yada" 

30 minutes later, Ben walks away from Annie's desk. Ben bumps into his manager, and tells her, Annie hooked us up. We're all clear to use her service. Meanwhile, Annie continues to think about Ben's use case. Maybe this or that could work. Someone else stops by and asks Annie if she has time to answer a couple of quick questions.

Annie grabs her jacket and make her getaway - "Sorry, I gotta head to lunch. Maybe Ben can help."
