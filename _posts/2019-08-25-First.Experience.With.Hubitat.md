The future is now. I wanted to make my home a little bit smarter. So I bought a [Hubitat](https://amzn.to/2ZlRdQm) hub and a [smart outlet](https://amzn.to/2LaxvgO). These are some notes on the experience. 

TL;DR - Making your home a "smart" one with Hubitat is fun. You should give it a try!

## What is Hubitat?
The Hubitat is a smart home hub.

A smart home hub is used to configure your smart home devices. You might want one device to report the temperature and another device to turn on a fan when the reported temperature hits 76 degrees. A smart home hub, such as the Hubitat, provides the coordination for the magic to happen.

## Reasons why I chose the Hubitat

There are a bunch of different smart home hubs on the market. In the end I chose the [Hubitat](https://amzn.to/2ZlRdQm), for a bunch of reasons.

### It doesn't rely on the internet.

A smart home hub that relies on the internet is annoying, wasteful and scary. Making internet access and some cloud provider additional points of failure is undesirable. Moreover, integrating your home with some internet cloud is scary. Privacy concerns, malware, yada, yada, yada ... The risks are too many for my naive mind to imagine.

So, I wanted a smart home that doesn't need the internet at all. A local and private hub is the most attractive feature of the Hubitat.

### There is an active community.

There is an [active community](https://community.hubitat.com/) of Hubitat users. Communities of people trying to accomplish the same sort of goals while hitting the same sort of roadblocks is a really good form of customer support.

### It's made for hacking.

This is just a guess, but it feels like the Hubitat is designed to be very customizable. It requires work from the user to get started, but it gives you more power to customize things. This sort of control may not be for everyone, but it suits me.

## First Experience

After a lot of research, I bought the Hubitat and a smart outlet. 

I connected the Hubitat router with an ethernet wire. I then went to my router's admin page and found the ip address of my new device. 

I opened a browser, went to the ip address, and configured a few things, such as the hub's name. I then, opened up my smart outlet and paired it with the Hubitat. 

Finally, I created a simple dashboard in Hubitat and turned the outlet on and off from my web browser. It took about 15 minutes from start to finish.

## Conclusion

Controlling real life stuff from your computer is magical. I plan on adding a few more devices and geeking out on the Hubitat in the future.
