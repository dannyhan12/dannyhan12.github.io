# Short summary 
Coding interviews are scary. Things are tips for myself to make them less scary.

# Study Tools

I'm using a bunch of things to study.

- [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is where I've been going to practice solving problems.
- [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/programmerdays/coding-interview-university) contains my forked version of a checklist of things to study.
- [top-algorithms from geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/) contains a list of algorithms to study.

# Tips

These are some tips I'm going repeating to myself.

## Take your time  
Solving the wrong question brilliantly is still wrong.

Your first impression of the problem, may be off. Clarify early.

## Work through examples

Before you create a general solution, solve some concrete ones.

## Choose your data structure/algorithm

What data structure(s) (vectors, lists, dictionaries) best solves the problem? 

Will you need to customize anything?

# Common Errors

Here are some of the common errors I've seen myself make.

## Off by one.

It's a common coding error in general. Combat it by walking through examples (with a few different inputs - odd, even, 1, 2 etc ..)

# Conclusion

No amount of preparation will remove all the fear and risk in interviewing. At some point, just go for it.

Also, even if you have a job, studying and even practicing for coding interviews is worthwhile. You will improve your skills for your current position and be ready whenever a new opportunity calls.
