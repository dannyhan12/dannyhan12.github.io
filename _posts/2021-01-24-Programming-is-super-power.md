Our family had an unexpected legal issue.

In response, my wife and I had to do some homework. Without getting into any specific details, we had to collect and review a whole bunch of data.

It was an interesting situation. I have a lot of experience collecting raw data and cleaning it up so that its ready for analysis. My wife has a ton of experience reviewing and synthesizing data. So, we applied our work skills to a personal issue, and we got some impressive results.

In many ways, programming/scripting/coding is a superpower. With a bit of coding, I can do things faster, more accurately and with less energy then any normal human could ever do.

This is true for other skills. If you know the law well, you can advise and take action even when mere citizens may be paralyzed with fear of causing more trouble.

But programming is turning out to be a general skill. It proves to be useful in so many different situations. These are one of the days I'm glad I chose to be a programmer.
