I was on a roll. I was being productive. I was studying, working out, writing, coding, etc ... But somehow, life got in the way, and I got off track.

Once the inertia of productive work was stopped, it became hard for me to get unstuck and start again.

Anyway, I'm going to just publish this mini article now. And I'm going to count it as a win. Hopefully I can write something of greater significance and accomplishment one day, but today, this is all I can muster.
