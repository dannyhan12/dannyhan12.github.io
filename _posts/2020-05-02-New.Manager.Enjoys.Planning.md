Recently, I switched from being an individual contributor into management. As a new manager, I'd like to document some things I'm experiencing in the moment before I forget I what it feels like being a new manager. 

The decision to switch roles was difficult for me. I listed the pros and cons. I discussed the choices with peers and mentors. I imagined how things could go horribly wrong or smashingly well. In the end, I said to myself, "You don't know, what you don't know", and I took the plunge.

One aspect of becoming a manager that I am enjoying is strategic planning. As a team member, the goals of the team can feel as if they came from some higher order mandate. Product owners are asking for features, so you deliver them. Or your organization needs to improve a process, so you automate it. There's some latitutude in how you build things and what may come first. But, it's easy to feel like a cog in the machine.

I still enjoy being a well functioning cog in the machine. Churning out high quality code is extremely satisfying. That's why I loved being an individual contributor and it's one of the reasons I was hesitant to become a manager.

But as I have played the role of team lead recently, I've learned that the goals of a team aren't just sent down from a higher power. Teams need to generate and motivate their plans. 

So, I've been spending time thinking about some fundamental questions: What's the purpose of our team? What do we provide for the company? How do we fit in with the other teams? How do we distinguish ourselves from the other teams?

Thinking about long term goals is fun and will be super rewarding, if we achieve them. It's scary too. There's a risk of making the wrong decisions or promosing more than we can deliver. For now, the fear is creating excitement. That excitement is new for me and different from just writing code.
