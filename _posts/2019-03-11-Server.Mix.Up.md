I was playing with my raspberry pi over the weekend. FYI, I was installing [plex](https://www.plex.tv/) on my Pi. Anyway, When I was done, I wanted to clean everything up and turn everything off. So, I turned off the raspberry pi by logging onto it and running the the `shutdown` command. Or so I thought ...

The next day, I discovered that I made a mistake. 

Instead of shutting down my raspberry pi, I ssh'ed into my web server and shut it down. So, this web site was down for almost a day. I'm not sure how I managed to mix them up. 

That is how programming goes. Sometimes you break things.
