Here's a git gotcha. It happened to me today, and I remember it happening at least one time long ago.

The scenario goes like this. You clone a repository. You open your editor (vim, vscode, etc ...) and start editing. Somewhere down the line, you realize that there have been updates at the remote repository, so you pull the latest version of the code base. You run tests and everything amazingly still works. You continue blissfully coding away.

However, for some reason, some things stop making sense. You change a file in the editor, hit save, run tests, but your recent changes don't seem to make a difference. You try to add breakpoints, but it never gets hit. You start adding print statements, throwing in syntax errors, but it makes no difference.

You think, maybe this code is using some previously compiled files, or maybe something got cached, but who knows. 

In my case, the error turned out to be that the upstream remote repository moved files around. The file I was looking at in `foo/bar/` got moved to `src/foo/bar`. So, even though I was editing `foo/bar/some-file.py`, the tests were using `src/foo/bar/some-file.py`. Oops.

After you do a `git pull`, you should check with `git status` for any untracked files. If you suddenly have untracked files, it's possible that someone moved some files around. 

I'm sure it'll happen to me again, but maybe I'll figure it out faster next time.
