I got a Hubitat and a single Smart device a [couple of months ago](First.Experience.With.Hubitat.md). But life got busy, and I couldn't work (play) with the Hubitat for a while.

I eventually found some extra time and got a few more smart pieces to play with. I got this [smart switch](https://amzn.to/2MOWG9g) and this [smart sensor](https://amzn.to/33whB7Z).

My plan was to use the switch + sensor + hubitat to create a thermostat. My apartment has a heater/air conditioner that uses a regular light switch to control a fan that blows hot or cool air. So, I replaced this regular dumb switch with the smart switch. I had very little experience in this sort of home electrical work, but I eventually got it all to work. I did accidentally touch the side of a live switch and felt a jolt of electric shock. Luckily, I survived. Even more luckily, the temperature sensor didn't require any electrical work. It just worked.

After I connected the switch and the sensor to hubitat, I created some apps and a dashboard. Here's my first dashboard.

Here's description of what the dashboard is displaying. It says, the AC switch should turn on at a high temperature of 75 and should turn off if the temperature hits 74. The current temperature is 73.4, so the switch is off. Finally, the temperature sensor has 75% battery.

Setting up this dashboard was a bit confusing, and a little buggy. The confusing part was figuring out how to make the low-temperature and high-temperature tiles. If you click on them, you can adjust my "thermostat" so that the AC switch turns on and off at different temperatures. It involved setting up some "global variables". After some trial and error I found out what I needed to do and got it working. The buggy part is that the layout of the tiles is different on different devices. I still haven't figured out what's wrong there.

So, it's all working OK, and I'm quite happy with it all. One thing I don't like is that my temperature sensor doesn't seem to update as often as I think it should. I'm going to try out some other temperature sensors to see if different devices behave better.

For those interested but worried about taking on a similar project, all of this work took me a couple of hours. This includes setting up the hardware (switches, sensors and hubitat) and then setting up the software (a dashboard with a few simple rules and triggers). And that's for an absolute beginner. 

This whole experience has been a fun and useful learning experience. I'm planning on adding some more devices to my smart home soon. You should give it a try too.
