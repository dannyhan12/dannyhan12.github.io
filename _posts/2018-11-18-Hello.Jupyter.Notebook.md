I've heard about Jupyter Notebook for a while, and I thought I'd give it a try today.

## Installation

The official Jupyter Notebook site recommends to install using Anaconda, which I did. And then I uninstalled it. The package was over 2GB big and it installed a lot of other stuff that I don't think I need. I may come to find that I am missing some cool features (or I may never know about them). In any case, I rather start with a more minimal tool set and work my way up.

After I removed Anaconda, I installed the python3 version with pip. This proved to be a more lightweight solution.

## Hello World

After installing, I wanted to make a quick "hello world" notebook. It was pretty straightforward. Here are the steps.

1. Start the jupyter notebook program.

    ```jupyter notebook```
    
    This starts a local server and launches your web browser to connect to the server. 

2.  Add a new file, named `my-first-notebook`. This creates a file called `my-first-notebook.ipynb`. 

3. Add some code

    `print("Hello world")`

4. Click run and confirm it works.

5. Save the notebook. This writes a json blob to my-first-notebook.ipynb which encodes our little hello world program.

## Parting thoughts

My first impression is that the jupyter notebook is a slick tool. 

I'm excited to see what others are doing with it, and to use it to solve some problems of my own.
