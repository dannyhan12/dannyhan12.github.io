I have so many things that I would like to do.

Whenever I think of something, I add it a file I call "backlog.md". This is a file in markdown describing things I want or have to do. The file is organized in categories such as "chores", "health", "relationships", "studying", "reading", etc...  This file is a convenient and simple place for me to offload tangent thoughts and to rediscover old ideas.

For better or worse, my backlog.md file is now 1150 lines long and growing. Before it gets any longer, I'd like a plan to get stuff done and reduce the size of my backlog.

So, I am trying something new. I chose one item from each of my backlog categories to make a big TODO list. I'll work on these items until they're done, and I won't work on anything else.

Some of the items are: read the pre-work in Google Machine Learning Crash Course, write an email to an college friend, clean up dropbox folder, switch one of my prescriptions to auto-refill etc... 

This new plan will force me to finish items from less "fun" categories, like chores.
