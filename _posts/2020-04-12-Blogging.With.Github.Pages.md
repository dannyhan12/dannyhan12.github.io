I've tried a bunch of different blogging platforms in my day. I used out-of-the-box tools like Blogger and Wordpress for a while. I also wrote a completely home-made application based on Python/Flask for some time. There's plusses and minuses to everything, so it's hard to say what tool is the best for you. For me, my interests keep on changing, so, the right tool seems to change as well.

In the end, the blogging software doesn't matter nearly as much as the person writing the blog. I've had long periods where I stopped writing and publishing. None of the above blogging platforms could've helped me there. If you want to be a successful blogger, just start writing.

With that said, I'm now giving [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) a try.

## Why github pages? 

It's free. Before, I was paying $5/month to self host. I can afford $5/month, but free is even more affordable.

It's easy. I write in markdown and save my posts to github already. So switching my blogging/publishing to github pages doesn't involve any extra work. It's actually less work.

It seems like the right choice today. Github recently became part of Microsoft and Microsoft seems to be very developer friendly. If I'm wrong, and things aren't so friendly here, I can always move this blob of text somewhere else.

## Initial Impressions

I was able to get something up and working in a few minutes. But then, I found [this guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) which helped me transform my barebones site into a more fully featured blog. 

I forked [the repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), renamed it, and then dropped my old blog posts into the _posts directory. And everything just worked.

There seems to be some support for adding comments with disqus and getting statistics with google analytics. Blogging isn't about getting comments and user hits, but it does feel good when those come along. So, I'll be working on that next.

## Parting thoughts

This post is mostly meant as a reminder to myself of when I switched blogging platforms, and what I was thinking and feeling today. New tools are fun. If this entices me to write a bit more, than it is worth the time.
