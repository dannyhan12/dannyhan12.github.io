I have been a vim based developer for most of my programmer life. Recently, I've started to use Visual studio code. I like it so far.

## Nice new features
It feels relatively lightweight. Not as light as tmux and vim, but not as bad as some other IDEs.

Customization of user settings is done really well. They are easy to find, easy to see the default settings and easy to spot what you have customized. It's very intuitive. 

Testing and debugging is vastly superior with an IDE over vim. I can actually set breakpoints and debug both my application and unit test code.

## Still lacking (or my user error/ignorance)
Over the years I became proficient in my vim + tmux ways. It'll take some time before I feel as comfortable in VSCode as I did before. 

I'm not sure what I should be doing in terms of back up. Lots of configuration doesn't seem to be version controlled.
