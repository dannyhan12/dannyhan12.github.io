I started reading "Thinking in Systems: A Primer", by Donella H. Meadows, but I didn't finish it.

I was excited to read it. I was thinking it might give me some new ideas.

But I found it disappointing. I felt like it was an info-mercial. The author kept me on the hook with interesting quotes from famous folks in the past. And then, the chapters would end, and I was left waiting for the punch line. There is a lot of discussion saying that there are lots of systems every where we look, which is fine and good, but I wanted to hear more about dissecting the systems that I personally encounter. What are the steps for identifying the bounds of any given system and how can I work to improve them?  There just wasn't enough practical information.

There were lots of examples of systems presented. The author spoke about how people may be thinking with too small or large scopes and thus miss crucial aspects about how to analyze and improve things. 

Perhaps this was my fault. Maybe I should have slowed down, and thought more. The book is relatively easy to read and does make you think. Maybe you get more out of it than me.
