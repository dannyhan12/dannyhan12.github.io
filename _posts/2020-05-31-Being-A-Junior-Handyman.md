Over the weekend, I completed a DIY home project. Woohoo!

I repaired some under cabinet lights. It's a trivial job for anyone with any handyman skills. Since, I don't have any such skills, it was a good-sized job for me.

It started a couple of months ago. We noticed that the lights weren't turning on anymore. Someone else had installed the lights originally, so I wasn't sure how it worked. The first thing we noticed was that the wiring was an utter mess. The lines were tangled together, like a big ball of spaghetti. The wires were also randomly spliced and patched together with electric tape. We wondered how this ever worked at all and that we were fortunate that it didn't all burst into flames. I was tempted to rip it all out and install something from scratch.

I'm glad I didn't<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>. After some clean up and labelling we were able to confirm that all of the lights were still working <sup name="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. The problem was a single faulty switch. So, I ordered a replacement.

When the switch arrived, I tested it. The new switch fixed the problem. Now, the challenge was to install the switch to its final position. As I did so, I started to realize why the person who did the original installation did so much cutting and patching of wires. They were trying to thread the wires through the cabinets while making the holes in the cabinets as narrow as possible.

Faced with the same constraints, I chose the same compromise <sup name="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>. I cut the wires and reattached them together. Here is where I made one improvement <sup name="a4">[4](#f4)</sup>; I joined the wires together with wire nuts instead of using electrical tape. The nuts keep the wires together better and look cleaner. They are also easier to remove and reattach, if necessary.

This DIY project was humbling. As I went through it, I was reminded me of a lot of lessons that I have already learned when I was starting to program.
