Comments are fun, but it could be tricky to implement from scratch. I went this easy route, and used [Disqus](https://disqus.com), to add comments to my site.

## Why use disqus
I just added [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) to my application; it took about 10 minutes. Now, you can add comments to any of my blog posts. For example, scroll down on this page, and you should be able to add comments. You can check out the community/channel at [https://disqus.com/home/forums/programmerdays/](https://disqus.com/home/forums/programmerdays/). 

Using this service saves me from a lot of work. I don't have to set up a database to save comments. I don't have to deal with users and their passwords. I also get a nice admin panel from disqus. 

All that is left is to get some of you readers to leave some comments. So, do your part.
