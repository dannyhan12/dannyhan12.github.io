I finished the coursera course, [On Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). It was a quick and easy course. The payoff size was proportional to the investment, pretty small.

There were a lot of common sense tips. You should spend time on challenging material, not just rehashing the stuff you already know. Actively testing and working through problems is better than just passively highlighting material. You should take breaks when you get stuck. Of course, the common sense stuff is much easier said than done.

There was also some discussion on the anatomy of the brain. I doubt I will remember the difference between the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex. I don't think this technical jargon will impact my ability to learn.

In any case, because it was so quick, I don't mind the time I spent working on it. I'd recomend it to a friend.
