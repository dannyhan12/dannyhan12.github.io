I've been building a new web application. The *stack* includes Flask, gunicorn, supervisord, and nginx. It works (hooray!) most of the time, but when it doesn't, logs are your friends. This article will log where to find those logs.

## Summary of logs


|Application | How to specify | Example / Link|
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| nginx|In config file | See `access_log` and `error_log` fields.<br>For example, [see my nginx configuration file](https://github.com/programmerdays/Pymarksite/blob/master/conf/Pymarksite.nginx.conf#L21).|
| supervisord |In config file |For ubuntu, see fields `logfile` and `childlogdir` in `/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf`.
| supervisord (Your app) |In config file|For ubuntu, see fields `stdout_logfile` and [related child log fields](http://supervisord.org/logging.html#child-process-logs).<br> For example, see [my supervisor conf file](https://github.com/programmerdays/Pymarksite/blob/master/conf/Pymarksite.supervisor.conf#L9).|
| gunicorn | In gunicorn start command | See parameters `access-logfile`.<br>For example, see [my gunicorn start command](https://github.com/programmerdays/Pymarksite/blob/master/conf/Pymarksite.supervisor.conf#L2).|
| flask | In application | You can redirect the flask logs into the gunicorn logs. For example, see  `logging.getLogger('gunicorn.error')` in [my app](https://github.com/programmerdays/Pymarksite/blob/master/app/__init__.py#L14).|

## Couple of notes
For ease of remembering, I put all the logs related to my app, Pymarksite, into a single directory, `/var/log/Pymarksite`. This makes it easy to find my logs.

### Log Maintenance
I haven't set up anything yet to clean up my old logs. It's another thing on the to do list. 

### Conclusion
Logs are useful if you 1) create them and 2) know where they are.
