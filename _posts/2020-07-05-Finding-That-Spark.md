Lately, I've been feeling burnt out.

I don't feel like doing anything productive. The thought of opening the laptop and sitting in front of a monitor is exhausting. I don't want to do anything at all.

These feelings have hit me before. It arrives after weeks and months of relentless work. Usually, it's overwork from multiple sources. Work and home life gets to be too much. The cure is obvious - rest.

It's hard to find a balance. You want to do great things. So, you take on more responsibility and accept greater challenges. You push yourself. And then, you hit a limit, and you get burnt out.

Maybe this cycle of work and rest is embedded in who we are. Ingrained in our past, when we were once farmers or hunters and gatherers, we worked as much as possible when the weather was right. And we rested when the returns diminished. This cycle of work and rest works out OK if you actually rest.

But what do you do when resting is not enough? You take some time off and you come back, but everything is still the same. You don't have the energy and motivation to get working. When you do work, you're unfocused and slow. It's like the pilot light in your stove is out. Without a spark, you'll never get cooking again.

For me, the fix is to find a spark from somewhere else. Importantly, the spark works best if you find something else to work on that is somewhat related to the work you are *supposed* to be doing. For example, if I'm supposed to be writing some code on an application, but I'm sick of it, I can rekindle my enthusiasm by doing lots of peripheral work. I can try to get my application running on my raspberry pi in a docker container. Or I can set up some static analysis tools to run whenever I update my code. Or I can play around with vscode and see if there are any new updates or extensions that make development a little bit easier or intesting.

After a bit of tinkering on something else, I find it a lot easier to jump back into my main project again. 

This doesn't work so well if you pick a project completely unrelated to your main project. If you do, you end up with multiple partially complete projects. Context switching between unrelated projects is difficult. Working on project A doesn't spark enthusiasm for project Z. Project Z is new and shiny. You eventually abandon project A. So, choose your side product carefully.

This post was inspired by this [Fire and Motion blog post by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/01/06/fire-and-motion/). In that post, Joel argues that constantly building and shipping code amounts to a winning strategy. 

I agree with Joel for the most part. Always be shipping. When you are too mentally drained to continue, doing something else can help. Maybe you can work on the gift wrapping or try out other boxes to ship your product. Giving yourself a break, by shifting your attention slightly, allows you to do a few things. Even while you are "resting", you are still firing away. Redirecting your focus on something else, allows you to rest and reduce burn out. Working on something adjacent to your project can spark your interest back in your main project. 

It's a little trick that works for me. Hope it works for you.
