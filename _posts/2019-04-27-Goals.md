I like setting goals. It makes you think and plan. The necessary work becomes a bit less annoying. It creates a finish line. Finish lines are fun to cross.

With that said, here are my goals for the month of May:

- Increase my stackoverflow reputation points by asking, answering or commenting on a question. [My current point](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1870525/dannyhan12) total is 701, and it's been that way for a while.
- Finish reading "Get Programming with Haskell". I've read about 1/3 of the book so far. This is part of a larger goal to be an intermediate Haskell programmer. I am firmly at the beginner level now.
- Write a blog post or at least a summary report for myself comparing the differences between C++ and Python inheritance. This is part of a larger goal to be an expert C++ and Python programmer. My status for this is murkier - let's say I'm proficient.

That's it. Let's see how I do. I'll post an article at the end of May to recap how things went, and to set the next set of goals for June.
