Testing is important. It saves me time.

## Start with unittests
It's good if you code can be separated from the rest of the Flask infrastructure so that it can be tested on its own. 

It means you code is modular.

It makes testing easier.

So, more testable code is often better code. 

## Flask testing
Flask has some testing infrastructure that you can use. I haven't explored it yet. But I will.

## Conclusion
When you change your code, it's good to know that you aren't breaking anything.
