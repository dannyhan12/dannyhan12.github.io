Welcome to my home page. You can learn more [about me](about) here.

The primary purpose of this site is to host my writing. See my latest [posts](posts.by.date) or browse by [category](posts.by.category). 

I started this blog when I was a programmer. Since then, I've been spending more of my time leading a team of programmers. This blog is a very loose account of how I am spending my days. This includes coding, studying, learning, watching, reading, listening, doing or building.
